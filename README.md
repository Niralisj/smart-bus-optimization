# 🚌 Smart Bus Optimization Challenge

## 📌 Problem Statement
Urban bus systems in Indian Tier-1 cities (e.g., Bangalore, Delhi, Pune) rely on **static timetables** that fail to adapt to real-world conditions.  
This leads to:
- Bus bunching (multiple buses arriving together)  
- Under-utilized trips during off-peak hours  
- Unpredictable passenger wait times  

Transit agencies **lack tools** to forecast demand surges and adjust schedules in real time.

---

## 🎯 Challenge
Build a **Smart Bus Management System prototype** in **36 hours** that makes city buses:
- Run smarter  
- Stay on time  
- Improve passenger experience  

---

## 🚀 Features

### ✅ Use Past Data
- Work with at least two types of data (ticket sales, passenger counts, GPS logs).  
- Clean the data: fix missing values, format timestamps, remove outliers.  

### ✅ Simulate Live Bus Updates
- Pretend buses are moving in real time (loop/stream).  
- Update schedules as new data arrives (GPS, occupancy).  

### ✅ Fix Bus Problems
- Stop **bus bunching** (prevent multiple buses arriving together).  
- Avoid **empty trips** by adjusting frequency in off-peak times.  

### ✅ Predict Passenger Demand
- Use a **simple ML model / time-series method**.  
- Forecast ridership for each route/hour.  

### ✅ Show Before vs. After
- Compare **current schedule vs. optimized schedule**.  
- Visualize improvements (reduced wait time, better usage).  
- Display results using **charts or maps**.

## 📊 Requirements
- Use at least **2 data sources** (e.g., ticket sales + GPS).  
- Simulate **real-time data feed** (buses + passengers).  
- Build a **scheduling engine** (rule-based or ML-based).  
- Create a **prediction model** (short-term ridership forecast).  
- Make a **dashboard/UI** showing:
  - Original vs. Optimized schedules  
  - Forecasted vs. Actual ridership  
  - Alerts (e.g., *“Route 5 delayed – rescheduling now…”*)  
- Deploy as a **working prototype** (web, mobile, or CLI).

## 🌟 Bonus
- Show **live buses on a map view** with updated schedules.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Python (FastAPI / Flask)  
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JS (or React)  
- **Database**: SQLite / PostgreSQL  
- **Visualization**: Chart.js / Matplotlib / Leaflet.js  
- **ML**: Scikit-learn / Statsmodels (for forecasting)
